File "Medicare_Part_D_Opioid_Prescriber_Summary_File_2014.csv" downloaded from https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Claims/Medicare-Part-D-Opioid-Prescriber-Summary-File-201/e4ka-3ncx/data.

Description of the file:

"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has prepared a public data set, the Medicare Part D Opioid Prescriber Summary File, which presents information on the individual opioid prescribing rates of health providers that participate in Medicare Part D program. This file is a prescriber-level data set that provides data on the number and percentage of prescription claims (includes new prescriptions and refills) for opioid drugs, and contains information on each providerâ€™s name, specialty, state, and ZIP code. This summary file was derived from the 2014 Part D Prescriber Summary Table (Documentation available at: https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Downloads/Prescriber_Methods.pdf)"

Read in file in data frame format. View first few rows to examine.

```{r}
opioidRX<-as.data.frame(fread("Medicare_Part_D_Opioid_Prescriber_Summary_File_2014.csv"))

View(head(opioidRX))
```


Fix up the variables:
Make new, clean variable for RX Rate, since `Opioid Prescribing Rate` is a character variable with % at the end. Clean some variable names and change to factor instead of character. Clean up zipcodes for possible map visualization.

```{r}

opioidRX$MD_RXRate <- (opioidRX$`Opioid Claim Count`)/(opioidRX$`Total Claim Count`)

names(opioidRX)[6] = "Specialty"
opioidRX$Specialty <-as.factor(opioidRX$Specialty)
names(opioidRX)[5] ="State"
opioidRX$State <- as.factor(opioidRX$State)

opioidRX$Zip<- as.factor(clean.zipcodes(opioidRX$`NPPES Provider Zip Code`))
```

Include only States, DC, and Puerto Rico. Remove territories or military locations: "XX" "ZZ" "VI" "MP" "GU" "AS" "AP" "AA" "AE". Then remove unused State factor levels.
```{r}

opioidRX <- subset(opioidRX, !(State %in% c("XX" ,"ZZ", "VI", "MP", "GU", "AS", "AP", "AA", "AE")))

opioidRX$State <- droplevels(opioidRX$State)
```

Check distribution of data across States. Might want to add State population size to get ratio of RX/10,000 residents.
```{r}
table(opioidRX$State)
```
Download 2014 State OD Death Rate (age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 residents) data from 
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html
and read in file.

Combine 2014 OD Death rate (column 2 of OD_DeathRates) with opioidRX by State.

Rename OD Death Rate variable (column 13 of opioidRX)

```{r}
OD_DeathRates<-read.csv("drug_poisoning_deaths_by_state-_us_2013_2014-v7.csv")

head(OD_DeathRates)

opioidRX <- merge(opioidRX, OD_DeathRates[,1:2], by = "State")

names(opioidRX)[12] <- "StateODRate"
```


Make variable for median RXRate by Specialty. View and rank by Median.

```{r}
totalRX <- sum(opioidRX$`Opioid Claim Count`, na.rm = TRUE)

opioidRX <- opioidRX %>%
        group_by(Specialty) %>%
        mutate(MedianBySpecialty = median(MD_RXRate, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
        mutate(RXnumberBySpecialty = sum(`Opioid Claim Count`, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
        mutate(RXPercentBySpecialty = RXnumberBySpecialty/totalRX, na.rm=TRUE)


MedianBySpecialty <- opioidRX[,c(6,13)][!duplicated(opioidRX[,c(6,13)]), ]
View(MedianBySpecialty)

```


Use MedianBySpecialty to select Specialties to include in heatmap. Remove Specialites with median = 0 as well as surgical and oncology specialties, which are expected to have high opioid RX rates, no matter what.

Create tidy dataframe.

```{r}
View(MedianBySpecialty)

Specialties <- c("Emergency Medicine", "Dentist", "Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine", "Physician Assistant", "Family Practice", "Geriatric Medicine", "Internal Medicine", "General Practice", "Nurse Practitioner", "Family Medicine")

opioidRX_subset <- droplevels(subset(opioidRX, Specialty %in% Specialties))

TidyOpioidRX <- opioidRX_subset %>%
        group_by(State, Specialty) %>%
        summarise(SpecialtyMedian = median(MD_RXRate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
        complete(State, Specialty, fill = list(SpecialtyMedian = 0))

TidyOpioidRX <- merge(TidyOpioidRX,OD_DeathRates[,1:2], by = "State")

```


Make heatmap with States ranked from highest (top) to lowest (bottom) OD Death Rate per 100,000 and Specialties ranked from lowest (left) to highest (right) mean opioid RX rate.

```{r}

TidyOpioidRX$xlabel <- paste(TidyOpioidRX$State, TidyOpioidRX$X2014Rate, sep = ":  ")


OpioidHeatMap <- ggplot(TidyOpioidRX, 
              aes(x = reorder(Specialty, SpecialtyMedian, median, na.rm=TRUE), 
                  y = reorder(xlabel, X2014Rate, mean, na.rm=TRUE))) +
        geom_tile(aes(fill = SpecialtyMedian), color = "gray") + 
        scale_fill_viridis(direction = -1, option = "B") +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+
        theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust=0, size = 7)) +
        labs(fill = "% Opioid of \nTotal Prescriptions", title = "2014 Medicare Opioid Prescription Rates \nBy Specialty & State", x = "", y = "State OD Death Rate Per 100,000") +
        coord_fixed(ratio = .5)

OpioidHeatMap
